contains--->(adapter,strategy,factory,bridge,observer,decorator,template design pattern).
MISSING--->(with reference to syllabus book):facade,abstractFactory,singleton.
Idea-->facade-->create few classes which are using each other(these classes acting as blackBox), one main type class which take output from them , now this class can be used to return object to your facade class(implementing a interface).
Idea-->abstractFactory-->same as factory but here factory classes instantiate combination of two or more product classes instead of just one.
